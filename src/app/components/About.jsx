I'm a huge fan of classics like Pokemon, Naruto, and Dragon Ball, and I'm always excited about the latest releases from the Marvel universe.

            Besides my love for technology, I'm also an avid artist and designer. I enjoy sketching, drawing, and creating digital art. Designing beautiful and intuitive user interfaces is one of my favorite parts of the development process.
